These are some responses from ChatGPT, which tells me about the approach of my project, how I should start, and if it is achievable by me or not. With this project I am able to gain knowledge in initial game development libraries, and integrating few aspects of AI within it. The whole purpose of this project is to provide me with a stepping stone to the world of programming, and help me integrate my programming knowledge in building something.

Question:
"I have thought about a project. I would like to create a racing game for Mario, in which the player will compete against an AI bot in Unfair Mario. The bot will tackle all the obstacles, but the player (Mario) will track through the map for winning the race. Rate this project in terms of how it will help me build a good profile in the world of programming, and is it possible for someone with my expertise to create?"

Response:
- Profile Impact (8.5/10):
  - Combines game development and AI, showcasing applied programming and creativity.
  - Demonstrates algorithmic thinking and practical problem-solving.
  - Can be enhanced by adding polish (e.g., clean UI/UX, deployment).

- Feasibility (7/10):
  - Achievable for someone with basic Python and C++ knowledge.
  - Challenges include designing AI for real-time obstacle navigation and balancing gameplay difficulty.

Action Plan:
1. Start with basic game mechanics.
2. Incrementally develop AI capabilities.
3. Focus on simplicity and functionality for the first version.

Question:
"Has such a type of game been developed? I am referring to the plot of this game, obviously."

Response:
- No exact game combines "Unfair Mario" platforming with a racing competition against an AI bot.
- Existing inspirations include:
  - "Unfair Mario" for challenging platforming.
  - "Mario Kart" for AI-driven racing dynamics.
- The concept is unique and offers originality, making it appealing for a portfolio project.

Additional Research:
- Studying how AI is implemented in "Mario Kart" can provide valuable insights for bot design.

Outlined a detailed four-phase plan:

1. Phase 1: Setup and Basics
   - Choose a language and framework (e.g., Python with Pygame or C++ with SFML).
   - Install necessary tools and learn the basics of the chosen framework.

2. Phase 2: Core Mechanics
   - Design the game map and obstacles.
   - Implement player controls and collision detection.
   - Build a simple AI bot with basic movement and obstacle avoidance.

3. Phase 3: Racing Features
   - Add racing mechanics, finish lines, and progress tracking.
   - Enhance the AI bot with pathfinding algorithms and decision-making.
   - Introduce "unfair" elements like traps and hidden obstacles.

4. Phase 4: Polish and Deployment
   - Add visuals, animations, and sound effects.
   - Test gameplay and balance difficulty.
   - Package the game for distribution and upload to GitHub.

Next Steps:
- Install tools and start learning frameworks.
- Build a simple prototype to test basic mechanics.
